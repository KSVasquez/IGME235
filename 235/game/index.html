        <p>
            <strong>Dig Dug</strong> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way
            through the earth. <br>
            Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>,
            who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to
            inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]

            This <em>definitely</em> goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs,"
            or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too. <br>
