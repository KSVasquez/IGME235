                    Hey, my name is Kevin Salvador Vasquez, and I'm a second year Game Design and Development student at
                    RIT. I love making games, so I've been planning and designing and prototyping a plethora of
                    different game ideas. I like high difficulty, high execution games, so I mostly play bullet hell
                    SHMUPs and competetive 2D fighting games, but I've also have a soft spot for exploration games.
                    There is something I adore about delving as deep as possible into a subject, and not just only in
                    games. I'm also intersted in linguistics, studying both ancient and modern languages, and
                    conlanging, creating my own language with its own grammar and vocabulary and culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A while ago, I would have described web development and design as outside of my sphere of interests.
                    But as time moved forward, I've slowly begun to gain a greater appreciation for web development, and
                    I now see as something I can be excited to work with. From this class, I hope to be able to gain the
                    toolset to delevop games for the web.
                </p>
