            It's the year 300x. The Earth has been ravaged by careless humans, leaving an uninhabitable, polluted
            wasteland. The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon.
            The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren't happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before
            Gulfer gets at it. They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them
            out, Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves? It's not exactly clear.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is
            an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ,
            Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.

        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <blockquote>
            A lot of Megadrive shoot 'em ups look good but turn out to be a tad dull, mainly because they're just
            rehashes of the same old stuff. Gaiares, however, is different. The variety in weapons and levels make it
            difficult to leave the game once you've started playing. My only quibble is about the difficulty. Gaiares is
            one of the toughest games I have ever played, and I can imagine a lot of people chucking this to the back of
            their collection out of sheer frustration. Of course, challenge is something a lot of Megadrive games lack,
            so if you like a good blast and have a high tolerance for pain and frustration check this out.
